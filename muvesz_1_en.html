  <h1>The Gödöllő Artists' Colony</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg">
    The  turn of the 19-20. century is a time of renewal for the Hungarian art scene, in which the Gödöllő Artists' Colony, one of the most uniform-charactered workshop in the Hungarian Art Nouveau with numerous national and international rewards, played a significant role. Its members were versatile artists. We know paintings, graphics, sculptures, book illustrations, carpet-, furniture- and leather designs by them. They renewed the tradition of fresco painting and they belonged to the most prominent glass painting designers of their age. As a result, they received a lot of exclusive orders, the exterior and interior decoration of a number of prestigious buildings built at the beginning of the century  bear their names.<br><br>
    The two leading figures of the artists' colony, Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch (1863-1920) and Sándor Nagy (1869-1950) knew each other from their student years in Rome (1891). Since the summer of 1897, they worked together in Diód, Transylvania, where a Tolstoyan artists' colony gathered around them. The formation of the Gödöllő Artists' Colony began with the moving of Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch to Gödöllő in 1901 and the creation of the carpet weaving workshop (1904), and after a relatively long time, finished with the settlement of Sándor Nagy in 1907.<br><br>
    Among the members of the colony there were who settled in Gödöllő, others remained permanent visitors, "limited partners", friends identifying with the idealism of the founders, participating in the joint work. In 1905 the folk art collector Árpád Juhász came to Gödöllő, and Leo Belmonte, the carpet designs and leather work contractor arrived from Paris.  After that István Zichy, a former student of Baia Mare started to visit Gödöllő. In 1907 Endre Frecskay, who is mostly known from his landscapes, and Ervin Raáb settled down here. The twin studio of Sándor Nagy and Leo Belmonte, designed by István Medgyaszay was finished in 1906. The applied artist and architect Ede Toroczkai Wigand, who was in many ways connected to the colony, lived in Gödöllő between 1905 and 1907.<br><br>
    Traditionally the work of two sculptors can be connected to the artists of Gödöllő: Ödön Moiret and Ferenc Sidló , but Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch also made statues in his whole life. From 1908 young artists came to learn to Gödöllő, some of whom stayed here, just as Rezső  (Rudolf) Mihály and Jenő György Remsey, who became the founder of a dynasty of artists in Gödöllő. Of the outstanding women artists of the colony, Laura Kriesch Nagy Sándorné settled down with her husband, Carla Undi Sidló Ferencné worked in the weaving workshop. Mariska Undi was one of the most faithful followers of the ideals of the colony, but she never moved to Gödöllő. Vilma Frey, who with her sister Rózsa Frey moved to Gödöllő to the call of the weaving school, however, lived here until her death.<br><br>
    The members of the artists' colony organized group exhibitions; their largest public exhibitions were in the Nemzeti Szalon (National Salon) and at the Műbarátok (Friends of Art). They took part in all major international premieres of the era, and participated with great success at the world fairs in Turin (1902), St. Louis (1904) and Milan (1906).<br><br>
    The center of activity of the Gödöllő artists was the weaving workshop. Almost all artists produced carpet designs. They made common principles of life and lifestyle, they were the representatives of healthy lifestyle and sports, ahead of their time.<br><br>
    The most valuable pieces of the Gödöllő workshop in our collection are the carpets, graphics and glass paintings. The artists were among the reformers  of countless, in Hungary previously neglected genre, such as book illustrations. Their reform pedagogical and teaching activities were also significant.<br><br>
    We list more artworks as the joint work of the members of the artists' colony.  The theater in Veszprém designed by István Medgyaszay is decorated with the sgraffito and glass paintings of Sándor Nagy, and they also co-designed the interior of the artist home presented at the Milan exhibition. The closest cooperation developed between Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch and Sándor Nagy. Their common works were, among others, the demolished National Salon (1907), the partially preserved Hungarian House in Venice (1908) and the Cultural Palace in Tirgu Mures (1913), which is considered to be the highest point of their gesamtkunstwerk endeavors.<br><br>
    The First World War put an end to the artists' colony. Sándor Nagy took over the leadership of the weaving workshop from the deceased Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch in 1920, but of those artists, who remained there no new colony was formed. The renovation of classical techniques was followed  by the disciples of both Sándor Nagy and Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, their activities enriched primarily the art of the Church.<br><br>
