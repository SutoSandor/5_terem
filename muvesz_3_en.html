  <h1>The arts and crafts activities of the Gödöllő Artists' Colony</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg"> 
    The Gödöllő weaving workshop at the beginning of the twentieth century was the arts and crafts workshop of the artists' colony in Gödöllő. The spiritual leader of the artists' colony was Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, who together with Ede Thoroczkai Wigand and Sándor Nagy worked on the renewal of Hungarian art, especially Hungarian applied arts. The important goal of the era was the applied art that emphasizes the artistic design of everyday objects.<br><br>
The arts and crafts activities of the Gödöllő artists were determined by the movements of the second half of the 19th century in Europe - that encouraged the revival of arts and crafts. The experiences of the 1851 World's Fair drew attention to the need for the renewal applied arts. Thanks to the theoretical and practical work of the English Pre-Raphaelite movement applied arts was renewed in the second half of the 19th century.<br><br>
The theoreticians of the English Pre-Raphaelite art and literary group founded in 1848, John Ruskin and William Morris, formulated the tasks of renewing art in their theoretical works. In their Arts and Crafts Movement they proclaimed that art should reach everyone, and should be present everywhere. Their artistic vision was closely related to utopian socialist ideas, they linked the idea of changing the world to the program of making the environment, particularly household objects more beautiful. They claimed that hand-made production of household objects (from furniture and textile to lamps and books) is suitable for the quality improvement of the everyday lives of ordinary people. They praised hand-crafts and called for the raising of the artistic standards of industrial products. <br><br>
In 1885, Secretary of Public Education Ágoston Trefort founded the Magyar Iparművészeti Társulat (Society of Hungarian Applied Arts), which he made responsible for organizing exhibitions. In this his biggest helpers were Jenő Radisics and György Ráth.<br><br>
In the 1890s art professionals were preoccupied with the issue of the development of Hungarian art industry,  they studied the relations between art industry and folk art and art industry and fine art.<br><br>
In the journal Magyar Iparművészet (Hungarian Applied Arts) one can read about the renewal of the arts and the tasks related to this. Kamill Fittler wrote about the establishment of the Országos Magyar Iparművészeti Iskola (National School of Applied Arts), where in addition to theoretical studies practical education should also be emphasized, so that they can produce artistically trained human forces for the various branches of industry. The students should be able to give artistic nature to their industrial works. He deemed it important from both pedagogical and national economical point of view that people purchased applied art objects for their modern home in Hungary. <br><br>
In the last years of the 19th century Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, Sándor Nagy and Ede Wigand were captivated by this idea, their objectives luckily met the applied art renewal efforts of the era. They played a leading role in the selection of the Hungarian objects for the 1900 Paris World's Fair. From 1899 Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch was a member of the Iparművészeti Társulat (Arts and Crafts Society), Ede Wigand held regular office hours, when he helped designers and craftsmen to design furniture. <br><br>
Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch popularized the importance of applied arts and the founding of unique Hungarian characteristics in his writings and lectures in Budapest and the countryside. He claimed that the applied arts that is acceptable for the Hungarian people would be born if they studied folk art and started out from its candid clean motifs. He regarded folk art the true, instinctively cultivated applied art, where material, form and function creates a perfect unit.<br><br>
The upbringing of children and education was important for the art of the Gödöllő artists. Primarily it was the turn of the century cult of children that touched them when they wanted to make books for children more beautiful, interesting and aesthetic. In their children's book illustrations an intimate identification with the child's world, a new kind of psychological approach can be observed. The beginning of the twentieth century throughout Europe is the period of the spread of the artistic illustrations and modern, art nouveau decorations that were equal of the text. In Gödöllő Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch , Sándor Nagy and his wife Laura Kriesch, Rezső Mihály and Mariska Undi were the ones who worked the most in this field.<br><br>
In the Art Nouveau era ex-libris design was very widespread, it was a part of book decoration art,  we can meet them in large numbers among the works of Sándor Nagy.<br><br>
Furniture design is also a part of the above-described multi-arts activity. The most complete ensemble of furniture is the bedroom designed for Frey Rózsa, which was kept almost intact by the weaver's daughter, Magda Feit, and  given to the Gödöllő Town Museum. An interesting piece of our exhibition is the atelier table of Sándor Nagy designed by Ede Toroczkai Wigand,  and his dining room designed for the 1906 World Expo in Milan.<br><br>
