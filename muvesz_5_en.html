  <h1>Sculpture and medallic art</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg"> 
    In the time of the Gödöllő Artists' Colony a significant change could be observed in comparison with the sculpture of the 19th century. Architectural sculpture was increasingly characterized by being integral part of the façade and the spatial masses rather than appearing as a set of autonomous sculptural elements. In portrait sculpture those works came to the fore that wanted to represent  the soul, giving a greater role to the facial features of the individual. In this period, primarily due to changes in the housing culture, the role of the statuette also increased.<br><br>
The period of the turn of the 19th and 20th century is one of the richest and most prominent chapters in the history of Hungarian medallic art. To order a medal or a plaquette was more affordable for a wider audience than to have a painting or a sculpture, and copies could be distributed also. The internal development of medallic art, the changed technology, the use of the new enhanced reducing machine, that ensured  the reproduction of the new types of medals, also promoted the boom. With its help the general public could get excellent artistic works at affordable prices. Commemorative medals made for a variety of occasions became fashionable.<br><br>
Very little is known about the sculptural activity of the Gödöllő Artists' Colony. There is no authentic record of that, if there was a sculpture workshop, or sculpture education in Gödöllő, similarly to the weaving workshop. Photographic evidence shows Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, as he is making his wife's statue in his workshop in Gödöllő. There is also a photo of Ferenc Sidló, which shows the artist in his own studio, among his sculptures. The artists made statues based on the sculptural training acquired at painting classes.<br><br>
From the artists' of the Gödöllő colony mainly Ödön Moiret and Ferenc Sidló can be regarded as sculptors.<br><br>
Ödön Moiret's first teacher was his uncle, Albert Schickedanz. In his early works we can recognize mainly the portraits of his family members. There are often German or Hungarian texts on his sculptures, with which, like his fellow Gödöllő artists, he intended to make the understanding of his symbols (with Ildiko Nagy's words) "loaded with ideas  and verbal messages" easier.  In 1920 he settled in Vienna, but kept in touch with the Gödöllő artists, friends. He made the tomb of Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, which was inaugurated in 1930 in the Budapest Farkasréti cemetery.<br><br>
Ferenc Sidló's drawing talent manifested early, and it helped him to get to an artistic career. At the age of fifteen he was already sculpting. After the School of Applied Arts in Budapest he attended sculpture training at the Academy of Vienna, then in Munich, and later in Rome. His name appeared on exhibitions together with the Gödöllő artists. Under the influence of Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch in addition to sculpture he made textile-, ceramics- and furniture plans, and we know of completed works as well. The orders he got in the First World War brought him national fame. He made the sculpture of the National Sacrifice, erected in Budapest, then he sculpted the statue of Archduke Joseph as well. His fame brought more public sculpture orders in Budapest and elsewhere in Hungary. From 1924 he taught at the College of Fine Arts (now the University of Fine Arts), his sculptural activities were rewarded with several awards.<br><br>
From the artists of the Gödöllő Artists' the sculptural activity of Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch and Rezső Mihály's  ceramic sculptures made for the Zsolnay factory, should also be mentioned, but these are rather just excursions to the field of sculpture.<br><br>
