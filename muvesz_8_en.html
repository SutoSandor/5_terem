  <h1>The life of Sándor Nagy and his wife Laura Kriesch in Gödöllő after 1920</h1><br>
  <p id="szoveg"> 
    After Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch's death in 1920 the weaving workshop continued to function, but Sándor Nagy and his wife took over the leadership. Sándor Nagy, because of his wall decoration orders entrusted his wife the teaching of weaving and the leading of the workshop, which according to the recollections was still working in the beginning of the 1940s. <br><br>
    The weaving workshop received significant orders even after 1920.  Floor carpets, woven pictures and tapestries were made for private orders, but we know about bigger state orders as well. Sándor Nagy and the weaving workshop made the corridor curtains of the Hungarian National Archives in 1926, then in  1927 they designed and made the national scout flag, which is now in the Hungarian National Museum's Flag Collection.  The flag was made by Laura Kriesch Nagy Sándorné, her daughter, Eszter Laura Nagy  and Irén Vandrák , their apprentice. The making of the vestment and  dalmatic of the Premonstratensian order of Gödöllő was also a significant order.<br><br>
    In addition to the textile design Sándor Nagy took an important part in the Premonstratensian monks' work, who were building a new monastery and gymnasium in Gödöllő. In 1925 he made his work entitled The Road of the Warriors (Hadak útja, lit. Road of Armies, in Hungarian legend the name of the Milky Way) on the ceiling of the gymnasium's staircase.  In 1925 only the gymnasium building was completed, but Sándor Nagy made a glass painting design for the priory chapel in 1927. The glass painting, based on the original design, was made in 1996 in the newly built chapel of the Premonstratensian St. Norbert Gymnasium, under prior Otto Fényi.<br><br>
    In 1923, he designed the stained glass painting for the sculpture hall in Wilhelmina of the Netherlands' palace in The Hague, entitled Hungarian homage to Queen Wilhelmina, ordered to show gratitude to the queen for helping Hungarian children in the First World War. <br><br>
    After 1920 Sándor Nagy also took part in the public life of Gödöllő. In 1924, he participated in the establishing of the Gödöllői Járási Közművelődési Egyesület (Gödöllő District Cultural Association) and later became its president. The association organized meetings, held scientific and artistic  presentations,  staged national issues, thus they institutionally organized the cultivation of people outside the school. They supported patriotic and classical literature, art and applied arts. Their goals included the organization of physical education, of sports as well. Sándor Nagy also took part in Gödöllő's sports life, both theoretically and practically. He was an active participant in tennis tournaments.<br><br>
    From the 1930s more excellent monumental painting works praise the art of Sándor Nagy. We can still admire the Our Lady of Hungary church in Pacsirtatelep, Pesterzsébet, where he designed frescoes and glass paintings (1935); St. Elizabeth Church of Pesterzsébet, where the triptych designed by the master is located in an environment fully painted in fresco (1937-41). Fresco painting is a heavy physical exertion, this was carried out by the master and his apprentice, Irén Vandrák. Sándor Nagy designed the glass paintings in the church of Nagykáta also in 1935. In 1942 he designed the sanctuary frescos of the Heart of Jesus parish church in Csorna. In 1948, at the age of 79 he designed the glass paintings  for the sanctuary of St. Joseph's Church in Mátyásföld. On the two sides there are Biblical scenes in a similar style than that of the glass paintings of the church in Pesterzsébet Pacsirtatelep, while in the central window there is a climbing passionflower in the middle, along with other decorative flowers and birds. The glass paintings on the two longitudinal sides of the church are designed by Imre Gaál, the Pesterzsébet student of Sándor Nagy.<br><br>
    Sándor Nagy lived in the house designed by his friend and fellow artist István Medgyaszay, until his death. He died on 14 March 1950, at the age of 81, in great poverty. He was buried in Gödöllő, Sándor Sík bade him final farewell. A  simple small wooden headstone marked his grave, with a Sándor bácsi (Uncle Sándor) inscription. His wife died in 1966. Old friends, fellow artists and residents of the town eased her loneliness. Today, the members of the Gödöllő Artists' Colony (and with them the founding artists such as Sándor Nagy) are regarded as well-known and respected painters and applied artist.<br><br>
